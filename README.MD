README: Biologically Plausible Neural Network Package

This package is a biologically plausible neural network implementation that extends PyTorch. It provides several biologically plausible neurons and layers for building neural networks with a focus on biological realism.

Features:
- Biologically plausible neurons: Implementations of various biologically inspired neuron models, such as spiking neurons, integrate-and-fire neurons, and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons.
- Biologically plausible layers: Layers that incorporate biologically plausible mechanisms, such as lateral inhibition, synaptic plasticity, and homeostatic regulation.
- Integration with PyTorch: The package seamlessly integrates with PyTorch, allowing users to leverage the extensive functionality and ecosystem of PyTorch while incorporating biologically plausible components.

Installation:
To install the package, use the following command:
pip install bioplnn

Usage:
1. Import the package:
import bioplnn

2. Create a biologically plausible neural network:
model = bioplnn.BioPlNN()

3. Add biologically plausible layers and neurons to the network:
model.add_layer(bioplnn.SpikingLayer())
model.add_layer(bioplnn.AdaptiveExponentialLayer())

4. Train and evaluate the network using PyTorch's training and evaluation APIs.

For more details and examples, please refer to the documentation and examples provided with the package.

Note: This package is intended for research and educational purposes and may not be optimized for production use.
