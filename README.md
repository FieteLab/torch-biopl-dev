`torch-biopl` is a PyTorch package designed to bridge the gap between traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and biologically-inspired models. It provides modules that allow researchers to:

* Train models using standard machine learning techniques while incorporating biological constraints.
* Simulate large-scale populations of neurons with realistic biological properties.
* Explore the impact of network topology on neural function.

### Core functionalities

* `ConnectomeRNN`
    - Handles rate-based neural populations whose recurrent connectivity matrix is specified from a biologically recoded (or synthetically initialized) connectome.
    - Includes under-the-hood application of sparse tensor arithmetic for efficient memory usage, enabling simulation and training of large-scale networks.
    - Supports the ability to flexibly spin up probabilistic connectomes, define celltypes and associated synaptic variables, and tune user-defined parameters via gradient descent.

* `SpatiallyEmbeddedRNN`:
    - Model constructors and helpers to wire up cortical architectures with varying levels of biological specification.
    - Configurable aspects include cell classes, cell types, cell subtypes, local connectivity rules, synaptic and neuronal nonlinearities, time constants, feedback wiring, and lots more.
